**Subject:** Recommendation for Mr. Lim - Cyber Threat Hunter & Incident Handler

> Mr. Lim demonstrated exceptional **dual-domain expertise** in intelligence operations and engineering:

> **Intelligence Expertise**:  
> - Applied **military-grade analytical rigor** (ROKAF background) to financial crime/threat detection, correlating OSINT/FININT with transaction patterns  
> - Developed **cross-domain intelligence frameworks** that linked blockchain risks (Tokenomist experience) to traditional FinCrime vectors  
> - Excelled at **tactical-to-strategic synthesis**, translating raw threat data into actionable executive briefings  

> **Engineering Capabilities (Hardware/Software)**:  
> - Leveraged **B.Eng hardware knowledge** to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities in payment systems  
> - Engineered **custom Python/Go tools** that automated data extraction and processing from SQL/XML sources  
> - Applied **systems thinking** to model attack surfaces across software networks and physical endpoints  

> **Unique Value Proposition**:  
> 1. Reverse-engineer threats using **hardware-layer understanding** of systems  
> 2. Develop **intelligence-driven software solutions** for real-time detection  
> 3. Anticipate attack vectors through **interdisciplinary analysis**  

> For Lufthansa's threat hunting role, this means gaining an analyst who:  
> - Understands attacks from silicon to software  
> - Builds custom tooling to close detection gaps  
> - Correlates threats across physical/digital domains
